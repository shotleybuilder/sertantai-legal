# Issue #13: Parse fails to start after cancel without browser refresh

**Started**: 2026-01-29
**Ended**: 2026-01-29

## Problem
After canceling a parse and reopening the cascade review form, new parses don't execute on the backend. A hard browser refresh was required to restore normal operation.

## Root Cause
In `ParseReviewModal.svelte`, the `lastParsedName` variable tracks which record was last parsed to prevent duplicate parsing. When the user cancels and reopens with the same record:
- `recordsId` matches `lastRecordsId` (same records)
- State reset block doesn't run
- `lastParsedName` still equals `currentRecord.name`
- Reactive parsing condition `currentRecord.name !== lastParsedName` is false
- Parse never starts

## Fix
Added a `wasOpen` tracker to detect when the modal transitions from closed to open, resetting parse state regardless of whether records changed.

**Commit**: 8faa3e2

```javascript
let wasOpen = false;
$: if (open && !wasOpen) {
  // Modal just opened - reset to allow re-parsing same record
  lastParsedName = null;
  parseResult = null;
  parseError = null;
  workflowComplete = false;
}
$: wasOpen = open;
```

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/lib/components/ParseReviewModal.svelte` - Added modal reopen detection
