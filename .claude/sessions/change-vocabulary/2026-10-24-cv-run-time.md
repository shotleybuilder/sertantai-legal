# Session: Reader run time (ACTIVE)

## Problem

Each change-vocabulary step's runs take too long (Jason 2026-10-24: "These runs take a long time … optimise and reduce compute time"). A CV-S05 fix round runs:
- the extent catalogue: 25 minutes alone, 60 minutes when sharing the machine;
- the extent check: about 26 minutes;
- the commencement catalogue: 13–15 minutes;
- golden: about 4½ minutes;
- the re-read and the rebuild.

Two catalogue runs in one round (run 4 bugged, run 5 again) cost two hours. The order catalogue takes 30 seconds, so the cost is in reading whole laws, not in the patterns.

## Todo

- ⬜ Profile one catalogue run and the check on a sample of laws (`:eprof` / `:fprof`, or timing per stage): XML parse (`SweetXml` in `Doc.new`), `Doc.lines`, sentence splitting, the per-sentence "reads the same alone" check, the regexes. Record where the time goes before changing anything.
- ⬜ Parse each law once and reuse it: cache the parsed `Doc` (or its flattened text and ids) keyed by the stored files' hash, so the catalogue, the check and the re-read don't each parse the same 3,357 laws again.
- ⬜ Incremental runs: re-read only the laws a change can alter. Key each law's result by reader version + file hash, and re-use unchanged results ("prove a change alters a run first"; memory: no needless corpus runs). A full run then costs only what changed.
- ⬜ The "reads the same alone" check: run it only for examples whose pattern or reading changed, not every sentence on every run.
- ⬜ Bounded concurrency inside a run (2 laws at once, under a memory cap), if profiling shows CPU-bound work. Memory: a 5-wide corpus run once crashed the machine; one law at a time is the rule until this is proven safe.
- ⬜ The extent check: it re-runs `Patterns.classes` per law. Share that work with the catalogue (the same result), or read the catalogue's stored result.
- ⬜ Measure before and after on the same inputs: the extent catalogue, the commencement catalogue and the extent check give identical output, in less time.

## Dependencies

- ✅ The shared CLML loader (`ClmlStore.law_docs`, `689c0adb`): one place to add a parse cache.
- ✅ CV-S05 suspended for it (Jason 2026-10-25: "Let's suspend and sort out run time"). This session must not change readings: each catalogue, check and re-read gives identical output before and after.
